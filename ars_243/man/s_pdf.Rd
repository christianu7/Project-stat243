\title{
Normalized exponentiated envelope function.
}
\description{
\eqn{s} is the sampling PDF found by exponentiating of the envelope function calculated from \eqn{u} and normalizing it using \eqn{int_s}.
}
\usage{
\eqn{s(x , T_k, h_T , hp_T , z_i)}
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A vector of values to determine the density of \eqn{s} at.
}
  \item{T_k}{An ordered vector of values on the support of the log of the objective function to calculate the slope of u in each piecewise segment.}
  \item{h_T}{A vector of values of the log of the objective function at values of \eqn{T_k}.}
  \item{hp_T}{A vector of the first derivative of the log of the objective function at values in \eqn{T_k}.}
  \item{z_i}{A vector of values that give the domain for each piecewise segment of the upper hull.}}
}
\details{
First exponentiate the upper function calculated from \code{\link{u}}. To make it a density, it is normalized by dividing by \eqn{int_s}.  
}
\value{
A vector of density values of the normalized exponentiated envelope function for values of x.
