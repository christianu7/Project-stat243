\title{
Cumulative density function of normalized exponentiated upper hull function
}
\description{
\eqn{S} evaluates the CDF of the exponentiated upper hull function calculated from \eqn{u} at values of x.
}
\usage{
\eqn{S(x , T_k, h_T , hp_T , z_i)}
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
A vector of values where the CDF is evaluated.
}
  \item{T_k}{An ordered vector of values on the support of the log of the objective function to calculate the slope of u in each piecewise segment.}
  \item{h_T}{A vector of values of the log of the objective function at values of \eqn{T_k}.}
  \item{hp_T}{A vector of the first derivative of the log of the objective function at values in \eqn{T_k}.}
  \item{z_i}{A vector of values that give the domain for each piecewise segment of the upper hull.}
}
\details{
\eqn{S} evaluates the cumulative density of the exponentiated upper hull function. First, determine which segment of the exponentiated envelope function x falls into, say the j-th. Add the integral on all the (j-1) segments before the j-th segment. Then integrate the j-th piece of the function over the interval \eqn{[z_{j-1}, x]} and add it to the preceding integral to get the CDF of the exponentiated envelope function at x.  
}
\value{
A vector of  values of the CDF of the exponentiated envelope function for the corresponding x values.
